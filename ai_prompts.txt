AI Usage Guidelines
1. Generate Interface & DB Schema from CSV
•	Use AI to convert .csv column headers into:
o	TypeScript interfaces
o	PostgreSQL table schemas
•	Example instruction pattern:
o	"xxx_id" → denotes a foreign key reference
2. Scale Functionalities with AI Assistance
•	Provide:
o	Previously built functionalities as references (including interface and format)
o	Naming conventions for models, functions, and APIs
•	AI helps extend new features with consistent logic and naming
3. Ensure Consistency & Type-Safety
•	Validate:
o	Code formatting
o	Strong TypeScript interfaces
•	Use AI to cross-check structure and types
4. Documentation Writing
•	Bullet-point initial thoughts
•	Use AI to rewrite and format them clearly into professional documentation
5. PostgreSQL Query Authoring
•	Use AI to:
o	Write queries in a clean, consistent format
o	Ensure readability and structure
•	Example: align clauses (e.g., SELECT, FROM, JOIN) and indentation
